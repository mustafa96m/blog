Hey it's Mustafa, and this is my first attempt to blog about tech, i'm not sure what topics i'm going to share but since we are on github it's going to be mainly about programming-related topics in general.
I see this blog as a thoughts/tech diary but it's open to the public that for I added disqus here to get feedback/critiques from you guys. 
thanks for passing by, and there will be a lot to come for later.
